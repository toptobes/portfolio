Small personal website because why not lol, nothing better to do with my life rn

uses absolutely no third party dependencies (beyond TypeScript and Vite, if you want to get pedantic).
Pure HTML + CSS + TS w/ my own custom tweening lib, small declarative shaders lib, and client-side router.

This is just the public version with the identifying info taken out; there's a private repo that's
hydrated and deployed to my official website using Vercel. You'll have to ask me for the link.

Also added a small API server which serves static content via Haskell + Scotty which is hosted via Google's
Cloud Run. It's fully static atm, but I plan to have it scrape my GitHub stars in the future to keep the projects
list up-to-date.
